# Using Components

One of the most powerful features of MDX is the ability to use JSX components directly in your Markdown files.

## Built-in Components

Natee Docs comes with several built-in components you can use in any MDX file:

### Admonitions

Admonitions are colored callout boxes for highlighting important content:

<Note>This is an informational note. Use it to provide additional context or background information.</Note>

<Tip>This is a helpful tip! Use it for best practices and optimization suggestions.</Tip>

<Warning>This is a warning. Use it to alert users about potential issues or breaking changes.</Warning>

<Danger>This is dangerous! Use it for critical security warnings or data-loss scenarios.</Danger>

### Usage

```mdx
<Note>This is a note with default title.</Note>

<Tip title="Custom Title">You can customize the title too!</Tip>

<Warning>Be careful with this operation.</Warning>

<Danger>This will delete all your data!</Danger>
```

## Creating Custom Components

You can create your own components and make them available in MDX:

### Step 1: Create the Component

```tsx
// src/components/MyComponent.tsx
export default function MyComponent(props) {
  return (
    <div class="card bg-base-200 p-4 my-4">
      <h3 class="font-bold">{props.title}</h3>
      <p>{props.children}</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Step 2: Register in MDX Components

```tsx
// src/components/mdx-components.tsx
import MyComponent from "./MyComponent"

export const mdxComponents = {
  // ... existing components
  MyComponent,
}
```

### Step 3: Use in MDX

```mdx
<MyComponent title="Hello World">This is my custom component!</MyComponent>
```

## Importing Components Directly

You can also import components directly in an MDX file:

```mdx
import MyChart from "~/components/MyChart"

# Analytics Dashboard

Here's the data visualization:

<MyChart data={[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]} />
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep MDX components simple** — Complex logic should live in the component file, not inline
2. **Use named exports** — It makes components easier to discover and import
3. **Add TypeScript types** — Type your component props for better DX
4. **Document your components** — Add JSDoc comments describing usage
